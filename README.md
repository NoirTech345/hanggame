Hangman: An Open-Source Word Guessing Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to deduce a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. In this open-source version, players select a category, and a word related to that theme is randomly chosen. The word’s category, the number of letters it contains, and any revealed letters serve as clues to the correct answer.

As the game progresses, players are allowed up to 6 incorrect guesses. Each wrong letter adds a body part to the hangman drawing. If the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed, the game is lost. Victory is achieved if all letters are guessed correctly before the completion of the hangman.

This open-source edition of Hangman invites players to delve into the code, modify, and even improve the game’s mechanics. It’s a perfect opportunity for budding programmers to practice their skills and contribute to a community-driven project.
There are currently 3 themes available. Supported language: Russian
